## üõ†Ô∏è Agent Tools

The AI agent uses 6 specialized tools to handle different music queries:

### 1. `get_artist_top_songs`

```python
# Example: "I want some chill indie rock"
get_genre_songs(genre="indie rock", limit=10)
```
**Returns**: Genre-appropriate tracks with diversity scoring

### 3. `search_tracks`
**Purpose**: General music search with flexible queries
```python
# Example: "Find songs like Blinding Lights"
search_tracks(query="Blinding Lights The Weeknd", limit=10)
```
**Returns**: Relevant tracks matching search criteria

### 4. `get_similar_songs`
**Purpose**: Find music similar to specific artists
```python

```python
# Example: "Create a workout playlist"
create_smart_playlist(name="Workout Mix", description="High energy tracks", size=15)
```
**Returns**: Thoughtfully curated playlist with flow analysis

### 6. `tavily_search_results_json`
**Purpose**: Search for current music events and concerts
```python

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
User sends natural language music query through React chat interface:
- "Find me some upbeat pop songs like Dua Lipa"
- "Create a chill playlist for studying"
- "Who's performing in Philadelphia soon?"

### 2. Agent Processing
LangChain agent analyzes the query and:
- Determines appropriate tool(s) to use
- Executes Spotify API calls through specialized tools
- Processes and formats the response data
- Maintains conversation context for follow-up queries

### 3. Response Generation
Agent provides brief, DJ-style responses with:
- Curated song recommendations
- Quick commentary about artists/tracks
- Structured data for frontend display
- Spotify URLs for immediate playback

### 4. Frontend Display
React frontend renders:
- Clean song cards with album art and metadata
- Play buttons linking directly to Spotify
- Conversational chat history
- Responsive, mobile-friendly interface
